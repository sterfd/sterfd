## Hey there, I'm Stef ðŸ‘‹

I graduated and defended my PhD in chemistry, where I was looking at how computational modelling of molecular interactions can not only *rationalize* experimental outcomes, but *predict* and help improve upon them. I learned how to use Python to automate data processing during my graduate studies, and fell in love with the âœ¨magic and creativityâœ¨ of it; so, I've been pursuing a career in software engineering. I'm currently at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data ETL pipelines and ML clustering algorithms.
